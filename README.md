> Uni Grad Project, lord help us

the current ideas:

Mechanic App: instead of the mechanic yelling from the other side of the building everytime he needs something you can communicate with him through the app and it tells you how is your repair going (what the mechanic is currently doing)
freelancing app: honestly don't remember much, I didn't really like the idea
